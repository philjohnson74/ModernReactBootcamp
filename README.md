# ModernReactBootcamp

## Running the Basics, JSX, and Props and More

Run the index.html files in inividual folders in VS Code by installing the Five Server extension then right click an html file in the editor and click Open With Five Server

This is OK for playing around, but is doing the babel transform in the browser which you wouldn't want to do for production code. You would want to run Create Create App to create an app for that.

## Create React App

To use Create React App, first install node.js then create apps using something like the following:

```
npx create-react-app app-name
```

Create a new folder and go into that folder in the terminal before running the above command.

Now cd into the new app and you can run start the website (it will automatically open the browser with the default page), run the build, or run the tests:

```
cd app-name
npm start
npm test
npm run build
```
